# Boot Linux from microSD card

This page describes how to boot Linux of the HMI SDK from a microSD card in QSPI boot mode.

Please note that you need to update bootloaders in Flash ROM on the EVK to use the QSPI boot mode. 
In the eSD boot mode, bootloaders stored in the microSD card are used, but bootloaders stored in the ROM are used when you use the QSPI boot mode. 
For information about how to update bootloaders, see [Update firmware (bootloaders) on EVK](./common_update-firmware.md).


## 1. Create a bootable microSD card

Get a microSD card ready. For information about requirements for the microSD card, see [1. Necessary Equipment](../../getting_started/#1-necessary-equipment).
And for information about how to create a bootable microSD card, see [Step 4: Prepare HMI SDK SD card image for demo](../../getting_started/#step-4-prepare-hmi-sdk-sd-card-image-for-demo).


## 2. Set boot mode to QSPI boot mode

To use QSPI boot mode, set the SW11 as follows.

	|     SW11-1     |     SW11-2     |    SW11-3    |     SW11-4     |
	|:--------------:|:--------------:|:------------:|:--------------:|
	| OFF {: .red }  | OFF {: .red }  | OFF {: .red} | ON {: .green } |


## 3. Set bootable microSD card

Insert the bootable microSD card into the card slot on RZ SMARC Carrier Board.

!!! note
	Please note that the card slot is different from a card slot used for eSD boot.

## 4. Boot Linux on the board

Press and hold power button (SW9) for 1 second to turn on the EVK.
You will see the following messages in the console.

```

You can login as root without password.

!!! note
	The messages in the console depend on the EVK and software that you are using.

If you are faced with an error in the boot process, it may be caused by u-boot configuration.
See [Configure U-boot](../../wiki/common_boot-linux-from-sd/#configure-u-boot).

## 5. Shutdown 

To shut down the system, run _shutdown_ command as follows.

```bash
shutdown -h now
```
{.hash}

After you executing the _shutdown_ command, it shuts down the system immediately.
And when it completes, you will see the following message.

```
reboot: Power down
```

Then, press and hold power button (SW9) for 2 seconds to turn off the EVK.


## Appendix

### Configure U-boot

U-boot is configured for QSPI/SD boot mode by default.
But if you used other modes, the configuration has been changed.
In that case, initialize U-boot configuration as follows.

Turn on the EVK, and hit any key to stop autoboot after you see the following messages in the console.

	U-Boot 2021.10 (Mar 31 2022 - 03:57:20 +0000)

	CPU: Renesas Electronics K rev 16.10

	Loading Environment from MMC... OK
	In: serial@1004b800
	Out: serial@1004b800
	Err: serial@1004b800
	Net:
	Error: ethernet@11c20000 address not set.
	No ethernet found.

	Hit any key to stop autoboot: 

Then, input the following command to restore the default configuration.

```bash
env default -a
```
{.diamond}

Save the configuration by _saveenv_ command.

```bash
saveenv
```
{.diamond}

To start Linux on the EVK, press reset switch (SW10).
