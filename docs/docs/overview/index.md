RZ/G HMI Software Development Kit (HMI SDK) is a HMI application development
environment for Evaluation Board Kit of RZ/G series.

Since it contains [Yocto](https://www.yoctoproject.org/){: target="_blank" } Linux with bootloader,
Linux Kernel, Cross Compiler, multimedia and graphics package, users can
develop HMI Applications easily and quickly with HMI SDK.

HMI SDK is specifically made for the supported Evaluation Board Kit with fixed
Linux components. For those of you who would like to customize Linux
environment, i.e., change memory map or develop your own board, you need to
build the Yocto Linux source code.

Please refer to How to Build HMI SDK.
