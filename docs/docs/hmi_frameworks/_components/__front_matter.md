## HMI Frameworks

The HMI SDK supports the following GUI frameworks and libraries that are appropriate for HMI.
In addition, the HMI SDK provides HMI sample applications implemented by using the GUI frameworks and libraries.
For more information about the applications, see [Overview](overview/index.md).

### [LVGL (Light and Versatile Graphics Library)](https://lvgl.io/)

LVGL is the most popular free and open-source embedded graphics library to create beautiful UIs for any MCU, MPU and display type.
It is a lightweight graphics library, and it works without GPU. In addition, a lot of sample applications are available.
They would be helpful to users.

### [Chromium](https://www.chromium.org/Home/)

Chromium is the most popular browser in recent years, and it is increasingly being adopted for embedded products.
You can implement HTML5-based solutions using Chromium.
It uses GPU for its rendering.

A browser-based GUI on Chromium (HTML5 solutions) offers several advantages:

* Feature-rich user interface
* Cross-platform compatibility
* Lower development costs
