## HMI Frameworks

The HMI SDK supports the following GUI frameworks and libraries for HMI development. It also includes sample applications built with these frameworks and libraries. 
For more information about the applications, see [Overview](overview/index.md).

### [LVGL (Light and Versatile Graphics Library)](https://lvgl.io/)

LVGL is a free and open-source graphics library that provides everything needed to create an embedded GUI with easy-to-use graphical elements, beautiful visual effects, and a low memory footprint. It is hardware-independent, works with any microcontroller or display, and does not require a GPU, making it ideal for resource-constrained environments.

A GUI built with LVGL offers several advantages:

* Lightweight and efficient for low-resource devices
* Highly customizable and flexible
* No GPU required, reducing hardware costs

### [Chromium](https://www.chromium.org/Home/)

Chromium is an open-source browser project that aims to build a safer, faster, and more stable way for all Internet users to experience the web. Chromium supports HTML5-based solutions, making it a strong choice for embedded systems requiring modern web technologies. It uses GPU acceleration for rendering, enabling high-performance graphics and smooth user experiences.

A browser-based GUI on Chromium (HTML5 solutions) offers several advantages:

* Feature-rich user interface
* Cross-platform compatibility
* Lower development costs

### [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/)

Flutter is a well-known open-source UI software used to build cross-platform apps for mobile, web, and desktop.
In recent years, its use has expanded beyond mobile to include embedded systems.

Flutter-based UI applications offer several advantages:

* Rich UI and user experience comparable to mobile apps
* Cross-platform compatibility
* Cloud integration and OTA support using extensive libraries
