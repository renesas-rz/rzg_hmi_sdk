### Q. What is the difference between VLP and HMI SDK?

Please see the figure below.
![](images/vlp-and-hmi-sdk.png)
The left diagram in the figure shows the development method without the HMI SDK. Users need to download and integrate necessary software packages such as VLP (Verified Linux Package), graphics library, codec library, and HMI framework or libraries.
The right diagram in the figure shows the development method with the HMI SDK. The HMI SDK is provided as an 'all-in-one package'. Users do **NOT** need to look for appropriate software and worry about how to integrate all modules.

For information about VLP, please visit the website [RZ/G Software Package](https://www.renesas.com/en/products/microcontrollers-microprocessors/rz-mpus/rzg-series/verified-linux-package).
