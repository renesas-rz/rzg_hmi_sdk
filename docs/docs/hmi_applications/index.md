# HMI Applications

There are several ways to explore running HMI applications using the HMI SDK on RZ/G EVK boards.


This page will guide you through:

*  Trying the out-of-box [Demo Applications](../hmi_applications/#demo-applications)
*  Building and deploying [Sample Applications](../hmi_applications/#sample-applications)

<br>
After completing these, you can also develop your own HMI applications by referring to the instructions provided in [Wiki](../wiki/).
